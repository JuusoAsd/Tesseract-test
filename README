Simple files showing my solutions to the tasks

Dependencies:
    - Pandas
    - Requests
    - matplotlib.pyplot
    - datetime

Running:
    Navigate to the tesseract test folder and run them on command line with "python assignment1.py" / "python assignment2.py"


Train of thought for the solutions:

assignment1:
    Had to refresh my mind on using APIs but quickly got to Bitfinex API documentation and found public API for candles "https://docs.bitfinex.com/reference#rest-public-candles"
    getting the data was quite simple, but I had to tool around with the parameters to get the correct interwal
    Did some formating so it could be plotted better
    Plotted simple graphs on how the data looks like, was planning on doing some more but i felt this was sufficient

assignment 2:
    This was more alien subject for me
    Luckily there is always an answer to be found "http://www.gregreda.com/2015/02/15/web-scraping-finding-the-api/"
    I checked to see what my network tab looked like and found the correct looking request URL
    I am not quite certain but I think I found the URL requested ("https://api-pub.bitfinex.com/v2/conf/pub:map:currency:sym,pub:list:currency:paper,pub:map:currency:label,pub:map:currency:tx:fee")
    after requests and a bit of data handling and the dataframe of tickers and fees are there
